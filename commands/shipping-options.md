# Compare Shipping Options

Help the user compare shipping options for a specific destination and parcel. Ask for the receiver's location and parcel details (or assume unknown if not provided). Use `find-delivery-options` to get available rates. Present options in a clear comparison: price, delivery time, service type, and (when available) CO2 impact. Make a recommendation based on what seems to matter most to the user — cost, speed, or sustainability.
