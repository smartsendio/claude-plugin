# Track Shipment

Help the user find and track a shipment. Ask for any identifier they have — order number, tracking number, or receiver name/email. Search for matching shipments using `search-shipments`. If multiple matches are found, present the list and let the user pick. Then load the full shipment details from `smartsend://shipments/{id}` and present the tracking history and current status.
